# ðŸ”§ Uploading Markdown and Notebook files to Github Pages

[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) is built on **Sphinx** and **MyST Markdown**. Itâ€™s great for structured guides, teaching material, or research documentation.

## 1. Install Jupyter Book

In your repo environment:

```bash
pip install -U jupyter-book
```

## 2. Create a Book Skeleton

In your repo:

```bash
jupyter-book create website/
```

This creates a sample book structure like:

```
website/
  _config.yml
  _toc.yml
  intro.md
  markdown-notebooks.md
  notebooks.ipynb
```

* `_config.yml` â†’ settings for your site (title, theme, etc.).
* `_toc.yml` â†’ table of contents (controls sidebar navigation).

## 3. Add Your Files

* Copy your `.md` and `.ipynb` files into the `website/` folder, or into a parallel folder:

```
 website/
    â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml
    â”œâ”€â”€ _toc.yml
    â”œâ”€â”€ intro.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started.ipynb
    â””â”€â”€ advanced-topics.md
```

NB: These have to be within the `website/` directory: I succesfully got around this with symlinks (e.g. `../material/1-introducing-command-line.md 1-introducing-command-line.md`)

* Update `_toc.yml` to include them relative to this file, e.g.:

```yaml
format: jb-book
root: intro

chapters:
- file: getting-started
- file: advanced-topics
```

## 4. Build Locally

```bash
jupyter-book build website/
```

Youâ€™ll get a static site in `_build/html/`.
Open with:

```bash
open website/_build/html/index.html
```

## 5. Publish to GitHub Pages

In your repo root:

```bash
jupyter-book build website/

git add .
git commit -a -m "commit notes"
git push -u origin main

ghp-import -n -p -f website/_build/html
```

* Requires [`ghp-import`](https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import) (`pip install ghp-import`).
* This pushes your built site to the `gh-pages` branch.
* Then enable Pages in **Repo â†’ Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Branch: gh-pages**.

Your book will be live at:
