This informal set of documents is designed for colleagues in the Geography department at Durham University to get beginners up and running with using Python for geospatial programming tasks.

As open source software, there are often multiple and conflicting options and advice to pick from when setting up Python. Figuring out the setup that works for you can be a large time drain and put people off from taking advantage of everything that Python has to offer. Here, I aim to give you - to the best of my knowledge - the up-to-date 'best' options for installing and using Python for geospatial analysis in the current ecosystem, as well as a broad-level introduction to the tools you have access too. It aims to be specific on particular quirks of the Durham system. It is not designed to be a comprehensive tutorial - it will instead, link to useful sources for information on installs/downloads as we go.

This material can be found either as an online Jupyter Book at [link], or at the GitHub repository at [link], where individual Markdown and Jupyter Notebook files can be found within the `material` directory in the root folder, numbered for ease of use.

NB - when stuck, generative AI is actually pretty good for coding purposes (although I like to minimise using it to ensure I have my own understanding of how my code works, as well as for environmental reasons). It's a good use of AI primarily because, unlike using it for writing prose, it is _immediately falsifiable_: if it starts hallucinating, then the code/solution it proposes simply won't work. You can go back and provide the error message, and it may even be able to fix its mistakes.
