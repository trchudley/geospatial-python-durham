# Quick start: Python for geospatial analysis

This informal set of documents is designed for my collaborators to get them up and running with using Python for geospatial tasks. As open source software, there is often multiple and conflicting options and advice to pick from when setting up Python. Here, I aim to give you - to the best of my knowledge - the up-to-date 'best' options for installing and using Python for geospatial analysis in the current ecosystem. It is not designed to be a comprehensive tutorial - it will instead, link to useful sources for information on installs/downloads as we go. 

Individual topics are contained in the markdown files and Jupyter Notebooks within this directory, numbered for ease of use.

NB - when stuck, generative AI is actually pretty good for coding purposes (although I like to minimise using it to ensure I have my own understanding of how my code works, as well as for environmental reasons). It's a good use of AI primarily because, unlike using it for writing prose, it is _immediately falsifiable_: if it starts hallucinating, then the code/solution it proposes simply won't work. You can go back and provide the error message, and it even be able to fix its mistakes.
